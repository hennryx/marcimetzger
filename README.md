Real Estate Website (Redesign Project)
This project is a one-page real estate website focused on redesigning an existing real estate web design. The goal was to create a modern, clean, and user-friendly interface that highlights property listings and essential details in a visually appealing way. The redesign emphasizes improved layout, intuitive navigation, responsive design, and enhanced usability to provide a better browsing experience for potential buyers and renters.

Developed as part of an assessment for employment, this project demonstrates my ability to analyze an existing design, identify areas for improvement, and deliver a more professional and engaging solution tailored to real estate clients and users.
